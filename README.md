## What this is (in one minute)

* **OpenRouter Integration Subsystem for Open WebUI**: this isn't a standalone service. Open WebUI loads it as a Function / Pipe.
* **Multimodal-aware routing adapters**: it inspects the payload (text + images/files/audio/video) and selects the appropriate endpoint + format the target model actually supports.
* **Responses-first endpoint routing**: it builds canonical requests and routes to `/responses` or `/chat/completions` depending on model rules, fallback behaviour, or attachments.
* **Operator controls via valves**: routing, limits, storage, security posture, telemetry, and templates.

**If you fork this:** it’s worth keeping the tests and running them for changes (`pytest`) — and running `pyright` as well.  
It keeps behaviour consistent and makes debugging a lot quicker.

For the full documentation, start with `docs/README.md`.
If you're reviewing code, start with the pytest test suite in `tests/`, 3200+ pytest tests with broad coverage.

## What You Get

🎯 **Every Model, One Place**
GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, Claude Opus, Llama 4, DeepSeek, Qwen, Command R+ — browse them all, try them all, compare them all. One API key, one bill. Plus model variants (`:free`, `:thinking`, `:exacto`) for specialized routing.

🖼️ **Multimodal That Actually Works**
Drop in images, PDFs, documents. The pipe figures out what each model supports and handles the rest.

🔧 **Tools & Web Search**
Your Open WebUI tools work seamlessly. OpenRouter's native web search is one toggle away.

🎨 **Complete Integration**
Model icons and descriptions sync automatically. Capabilities show up in the UI. It feels native because it is.

💬 **Clear Communication**
Helpful error messages, real-time status updates, and transparent cost tracking per request.

## For IT & Operations

⚡ **Production Hardened**
Rate limiting, circuit breakers, request admission controls, and graceful degradation — built for real workloads, not demos.

🔐 **Security First**
Encrypted credential storage, SSRF protection with HTTPS-only remote fetches by default (HTTP allowlist available), no secrets in logs. Designed for environments where security reviews happen.

📊 **Cost & Attribution**
Track spending per user, per session. Optional Redis export for billing integration. Know who's using what.

📝 **Audit Trail**
Optional encrypted session logs for incident response. Request identifiers flow through to OpenRouter for end-to-end attribution.

🛡️ **Enterprise Controls**
Encryption, retention policies, request attribution, and operational hooks your governance program can build on.

## Quick Start

**1. Install**

In Open WebUI: **Admin Panel** → **Functions** → **+** → **Import from Link**

Pick one:

**Readable bundle (easy to audit/edit):**

```
https://github.com/rbb-dev/Open-WebUI-OpenRouter-pipe/releases/latest/download/open_webui_openrouter_pipe_bundled.py
```

**Compressed bundle (same behavior, smaller + less clutter in the editor):**

```
https://github.com/rbb-dev/Open-WebUI-OpenRouter-pipe/releases/latest/download/open_webui_openrouter_pipe_bundled_compressed.py
```

Both are automatically generated from the same modular source code on every release.

<details>
<summary>Alternative: bleeding-edge from dev branch</summary>

For the latest development commits (may be unstable):

**Readable bundle:**

```
https://github.com/rbb-dev/Open-WebUI-OpenRouter-pipe/releases/download/dev/open_webui_openrouter_pipe_bundled.py
```

**Compressed bundle:**

```
https://github.com/rbb-dev/Open-WebUI-OpenRouter-pipe/releases/download/dev/open_webui_openrouter_pipe_bundled_compressed.py
```

</details>

**2. Enable**

Toggle the pipe **ON** (the switch next to the function name).

**3. Add Your API Key**

Click the **⚙️ gear icon** on the pipe → paste your [OpenRouter API key](https://openrouter.ai/keys) → **Save**.

**4. Select a Model**

Back in the chat, click the model dropdown — you'll see all OpenRouter models. Pick one.

**5. Chat!**

That's it. Start talking.
